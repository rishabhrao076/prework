#### App Idea: Collaborative Habit Tracker  
The app would be a hybrid of habit tracking and social accountability. Users can set personal goals (e.g., exercising, reading, drinking water) and invite friends to join or cheer them on. The app will include features such as:  
- **Shared Progress Tracking:** Teams can view each otherâ€™s daily or weekly progress.  
- **Gamified Challenges:** Earn badges for streaks, group milestones, or overcoming challenges.  
- **Motivational Nudges:** Personalized notifications or messages from friends to stay on track.  

This app aims to make habit-building more engaging and community-driven while providing the flexibility to track individual goals.
